Hangman is guessing game where two or more players. One player thinks of a word, and the other tries to guess it by suggesting letters. The word to guess is represented by a row of dashes (a mask), which gives the person guessing the word the only clue; the number of letters in the word. If the guessing player suggests a letter which occurs in the word, the other player writes it in all its correct positions. If the suggested letter does not occur in the word, the other player draws one element of the hanged man stick figure as a tally mark, and adds the incorrect guess to a list. The game is over when either:

    • The guessing player completes the word, or guesses the whole word correctly
    • The guessing player makes six(6) incorrect guesses thereby enabling the other player to complete the stick figure hangman           diagram
